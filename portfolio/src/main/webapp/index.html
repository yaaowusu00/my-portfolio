        <p class="aboutText" id="text1">
           My first experience with web development was an intersection between my interests in coding and psychology, as it was a
            <a href="placeholder">mental-health focused web application</a> 
           I worked on under the direction of Yale Computer Science Faculty. That project led me to realize how important 
           it is that we use technology to aid our communities and drive change in the world, and that technology and
            psychology can and should go hand in hand. 
           My interests in cognitive Science and computer science led me to pursue a joint major in psychology and 
           Computer science so I could continue to develop 
           my coding skills while learning about psychological principles to aid my designs.

           As a minority in STEM and a person that discovered CS relativley late, I am also dedicated to goiving younger students the opportunity to experience CS 
           and develop the confidence they need to pursue CS as they get older. During the schoolyear, I volunteer as a CS teacher to children through <a href="https://www.codehavenyale.com/"> Code Haven Yale</a> , and in summer 2020 I will be volunteering online through <a href="https://www.the-cs.org/">The Coding School</a> >
